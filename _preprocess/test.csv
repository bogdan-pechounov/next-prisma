The polyurethane exterior, accented by a subtle ""nook"" logo, is both strong and smooth to the touch; inside, a plastic shell in contrasting charcoal cradles your device while offering full access to the controls. But that's only part of the story. An articulation on the front cover allows you to fold it back and tuck the edge into the metallic clip on the back of the case. The result is a sturdy stand that gives you the option of using your NOOK hands-free in landscape orientation, in either video-viewing mode or typing mode. (The viewing mode offers a more vertical angle.) Proving that this is a smart cover in every sense, it also puts your NOOK HD into sleep mode when you close the front flap and wakes it up when the flap is opened. A laser-etched ""nook"" logo on the back-cover clip adds to the visual appeal of this superior product."
